\subsection{Householder and Givens Transformations}\label{subsec:-householder-givens-transformations}
$Q\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m} $ is orthogonal if
\[
    Q^T Q = Q Q^T = I_m
\]
A $2\times 2$ orthogonal matrix $Q$ is a \textit{rotation} if it has the form
\[
    Q =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        & \cos(\theta) & \sin (\theta) &\\
        & -\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) &
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
If $ y = Q^T x $, then $y$ is obtained by rotating $x$ counterclockwise through an angle $\theta$.
\par A $2\times 2$ orthogonal matrix $Q$ is a \textit{reflection} if it has the form
\[
    Q =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        & \cos(\theta) & \sin (\theta) &\\
        & \sin(\theta) & -\cos(\theta) &
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
If $ y = Q^T x = Qx$, then $y$ is obtained by reflecting the vector $x$ across the line defined by
\[
    S = \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}, \sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Reflections and rotations are computationally attractive because they are easily constructed and because they can be
used to introduce zeros in a vector by properly choosing the rotation angle or the reflection plane.

\subsubsection{Householder Reflections}\label{subsubsec:-househoulder-reflection}
Let $v\in\mathbb{R}^m$ be nonzero. An $m\times m $ matrix $P$ of the form
\[
    P = I - \beta vv^T, \beta = \frac{2}{v^T v}
\]
is a Householder reflection.The vector $v$ is the \textit{Householder vector}.If a vector $x$ is multiplied by $P$, then
it is reflected in the hyperplane \textbf{span}$\{v\}$.Householder matrices are symmetric and orthogonal.
